# Prints the tag that the currently checked out commit should be released as,
# or nothing at all if it does not warrant a release.
#
# Usage: bin/compute-next-tag.sh
#
# Tags look like `<autobrr version>-<release>`, which is what this repository
# has always published (v1.63.1-0 ... v1.84.0-0). Autobrr carries the `v` in its
# own version, so the prefix is the version itself:
#
# - if defaults/main.yml points at an Autobrr version that has never been
#   released, the release counter restarts at 0 (`v1.85.0-0`)
# - otherwise the counter is incremented (`v1.85.0-1`), but only if something
#   that actually affects the role has changed since the last release
#
# Determining the version from defaults/main.yml, rather than from the commit
# message of the pull request that got merged, makes the result independent of
# the order in which pull requests get merged, and lets any change to the role
# (bugfix, feature, dependency bump) release itself without a human tagging.
# The commit-message approach this replaced could only ever tag a Renovate
# commit, so a fix to the role's tasks was never released at all until the next
# version bump happened to carry it along.
